changelog

v1.0.14 - Ad revision, Version Control, Animation and Future Features [BETA]
-----------
- Added a new property to user for ad counter.
- Ads will now display less-frequently. Enjoy :D
- Added tutorial property - This will be used in an upcoming patch for (guess what?) a tutorial.
- Added version property.
- Implemented version control for ease of adding in new properties in the future (thanks Grim).
- Added rotation to ninja stars (delta-time). 
- New property 'kills' added and initial implementation.
- Skins table implemented, more prep for v1.1.

v1.0.13 - Ad removal and final pre-delta-time preperation.
-----------
- Removed ad from onPause event (pause button). Meant to do this earlier. It annoyed me too.
- Changed to 60 FPS - reflected all prior code to this change. Final preperations for full delta-time integration.
  NOTE: This build may perform poorly on older devices. Next build will fix this.
- Removed several pieces of redundant code in place from early delta-time work.
- Reworked structure in several places to eliminate unnecessary function work.
- New FPS function added to run seperately from delta and rounded number.


v1.0.12 - Performance - General Code Cleanup
-----------
- Removed unused forward declare.
- Further optimization changes throughout program in preperation of delta time. Some users may notice a small performance increase.
- Added toggle for display of FPS - Future release will have this in options menu (also not running nearly as fast as it is currently). 

v1.0.11 - Partial delta time support
-----------
- Initial framework laid for delta time
- Changed FPS counter for testing purpose (Yes, it's supposed to update VERY quickly. This is intentional for my own testing.)

v1.0.10 - Animation Edit - Performance Change
-----------
- Changed player hit animation. Should be more noticeable
- Revised java stack size - this may take a performance hit. Testing needed.
- Added FPS meter for beta testing.

v1.0.9 - Menu Addition
-----------
- Added version number on main menu.

v1.0.8 - Final known bugfix and HUGE performance upgrade
-----------
- Converted several files to wav.
- Stereo to mono on several sound effects for optimization.
- Normalized all audio.
- Changed all audio to 22k Hz.
- Fixed audio bug.
- Optimized load and memory storage - should be running and initializing far quicker across all platforms.

v1.0.7 - Performance
-----------
- Enabled largeHeap in build.settings. This should vastly improve performance across all android devices.

v1.0.6 - Beginning of asset enhancements
-----------
- Icon that displays on 'desktop' modified. NEEDS FIXED: https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/distribution/buildSettings/index.html#androidsettings
- Back-end work on website icons.

v1.0.5 - Performance Boost
-----------
- Additional noticable performance gain by destroying main menu scene upon loading main game scene.
  NOTE: While you will see a slight stutter switching scenes, this allows for a lot more memory to be used in the actual game scene.

v1.0.4 - Various
-----------
- Added instantiated ad to pause button.
- Tweaked what occurs prior to swapping to make transitions smother.
- [N/A but still useful knowledge]: Created poll on twitter (lasting two days). Static or skippable-video ads?

v1.0.3 - Refinement
-----------
- Refined ad network further. Final revision.
- Adjusted poof animation for more tolerence.
- Removed erroneous code that compiled anyhow.
- Removed unnecessary permission.

v1.0.2 - Bugfixes
-----------
- Samsung s5 (possibly others) poof animation glitch corrected.
- Poofs should now properly disappear when two are created simultaneously.

v1.0.1 - Ad change
-----------
- Made ad network a little more dynamic (user feedback positive)
