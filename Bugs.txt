- transition screen after game over isn't exactly smooth on s5 apparently (can someone else confirm?).
- re-do icon with 'free' being different somehow.

Yes, delta time is super handy for moving things.
But I'm a little confused as to why that tutorial recommends (effectively) adding a * 60 or * 30.
Delta time is typically measured in seconds so you can do math in real units(edited)

Like box:translate( 0, 5.0*dt ) with the typical dt would move the box 5px every second.
All the factors in the tutorial do is make math less clear.
Like, the above with the /(1000/60) would just move the box 300px/s rather than 5px/s. 
It still just as framerate independent, but now there's an arbitrary factor in there making things harder
